# Troubleshooting Reflection
One of the main technical issues I came across in this class dealt with the
installation process of Google Cloud onto my device. This issue was initially
caused by my first download of gcloud being accidentally deleted from my computer.
I had not taken the best notes for the first installation process causing a lot of
confusion for and making me realize just how important it was to take specific and
personalized notes that I would understand myself. When I installed gcloud the second
time around I was met with an error message that told me that the file/command that I
was looking for was “not available.” I began to troubleshoot by reviewing the readings
for **"2.1 Using gcloud for Virtual Machines"**. I coupled this with reviewing the **"Install
the gcloud CLI"** article on Google’s website. Even though I reread both of these sources
multiple times I kept getting the same error message. I began to freak out and decided to
read out to you via Element. A meeting time was set, but I continued to try to troubleshoot
the issue. I watched various tutorials on YouTube and eventually came across a solution. I
found that I had forgotten to move the file to my downloads file (`cd downloads`). Once I
realized this, I was both relieved and humored at myself that such a simple thing had
caused so much stress and confusion. I immediately wrote a detailed, yet short-and-simple,
list of steps on GitHub that walked me through the process of installing gcloud in
terminology that I would understand.
