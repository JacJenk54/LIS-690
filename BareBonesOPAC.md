# Bare Bones OPAC

## Instructions
1. Go to /var/www/html/
`cd var/ww/html/`

2. HTML Form
- `sudo nano mylibrary.html`

```
<html>
<head>
<title>MySQL Server Example</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>A Basic OPAC</h1>

<p>In the form below,
<b>optionally</b> enter text in the search field.
You can search by author, title, or publisher.
Capitalization is not necessary.
It's okay to enter partial information,
like part of an author's, title's, or publisher's name.</p>

<p>The date fields are <b>required</b>.
You can use the date fields to limit results.
I added some extra records,
which you can view to know what you can query:</p>

<p><a href="http://11.111.222.222/opac.php">http://11.111.222.222/opac.php</a></p>

<p>This is very much a toy,
stripped down
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_public_access_catalog">OPAC</a>.
The records are basic.
Not only do they not conform to
<a href="https://www.loc.gov/marc/">MARC</a>,
but they don't even conform to something
as simple as
<a href="https://www.dublincore.org/">Dublin Core</a>.

<p>I also don't provide options
to select different fields,
like author, title, or publisher fields.
Instead the search field below searches
all the fields
(author, title, publisher)
in our <b>books</b> table.</p>

<p>The key idea is to get a sense
of how an OPAC works, though.</p>

<h2>My Basic Library OPAC</h2>
<form method="post" action="search.php">
    <label for="search">Search:</label>
    <input type="text" name="search" id="search">
    <br>
    <label for="start_date">Start Date:</label>
    <input type="date" name="start_date" id="start_date">
    <br>
    <label for="end_date">End Date:</label>
    <input type="date" name="end_date" id="end_date">
    <br>
    <input type="submit" value="Search">
</form>


</body>

```

- Change IP adress **11.111.222.222** to **34.125.235.117**

3. PHP Search Script
- `sudo nano search.php` 

```
<?php
// Load MySQL credentials
require_once 'login.php';

// Establish connection
$conn = mysqli_connect($db_hostname, $db_username, $db_password) or
  die("Unable to connect");

// Open database
mysqli_select_db($conn, $db_database) or
  die("Could not open database '$db_database'");

// Check if search query was submitted
if (isset($_POST['search'])) {
    // Sanitize user input to prevent SQL injection attacks
    $search = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $_POST['search']);

    // Get the start and end dates for the date range
    $start_date = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $_POST['start_date']);
    $end_date = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $_POST['end_date']);

    // Build the MySQL query with a WHERE
    // clause that includes the date range filter
    $query = "SELECT * FROM books WHERE
        (author LIKE '%$search%' OR
        title LIKE '%$search%' OR
        publisher LIKE '%$search%') AND
        copyright BETWEEN '$start_date' AND '$end_date'";

    // Execute the query
    $result = mysqli_query($conn, $query);

    // Check if any results were returned
    if (mysqli_num_rows($result) > 0) {
        // Loop through the results and output them
        while ($row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result)) {
            echo "ID: " . $row["id"] . "<br>";
            echo "Author: " . $row["author"] . "<br>";
            echo "Title: " . $row["title"] . "<br>";
            echo "Publisher: " . $row["publisher"] . "<br>";
            echo "Copyright: " . $row["copyright"] . "<br><br>";
        }
    } else {
        echo "No results found.";
    }

    // Free up memory by closing the MySQL result set
    mysqli_free_result($result);
}

// Close the MySQL connection
mysqli_close($conn);

echo "<p>Return to search page: <a href='http://11.111.222.222/mylibrary.html'>http://11.111.222.222/mylibrary.html</a></p>";

?>

## Reflection
As mentioned in my relefction last week, I am really enjoying seeing how the back-end of an Integrated Library Systems works.
I know that this is a **very** simplified version of an OPAC, but it is allowing me to see how the systems are all connected.
I am still very inexpreienced when it comes to more complex coding, but I am actually starting to make connections
and understand terms and concepts that I was completely oblivious to prior to this class. I am interested to see how the UI/UX of
websites, such as UK's InfoKat, is achieved (although I know it is **far beyond** the reaches of this course).
